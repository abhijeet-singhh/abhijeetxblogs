      Hey there! I'm Abhijeet, a dev who just spent an entire day pulling his hair out over a bug that turned out to be... not my bug at all. Grab some popcorn, maybe a debugger too, because this is the story of how Brave browser gaslit me and my console cried in minified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's dive into the rabbit hole, one console error at a time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">Everything Was Fine... Until It Wasn't</h2>
    <p>
      So I'm vibing, building this slick React project using Vite. Nothing fancy, just your average component soup with some nice icons sprinkled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I deployed it on Netlify, excited to finally show it off. Opened it in Brave browser, loaded the app, and boom:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>ðŸš¨ Icons ghosted me.</li>
      <li>ðŸš¨ Text went poof.</li>
      <li>ðŸš¨ Console dropped this bomb: <code>Uncaught Error: Minified React error #130</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you've ever seen this, you know React is basically saying:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-zinc-300 pl-4 italic text-zinc-600">
      "I broke. You figure it out."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I clicked the link React provided and it told me:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-zinc-100 rounded p-4 text-sm whitespace-normal">
      <code>Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Translation: You're probably importing a component that doesn't exist. Classic. But I double-checked all my imports...
    </p>
    <p>
      Fun fact: This all went down while building <strong>FlickNest</strong> â€” a movie discovery app where you can search trending titles, explore binge-worthy shows, and keep up with the latest releases.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-zinc-300 pl-4 text-zinc-600 hover:underline">
      <a href="https://flicknestapp.netlify.app/" target="_blank">ðŸŽ¬ <strong>FlickNest</strong> â€” Live link</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">It Must Be the Icons</h2>
    <p>
      Naturally, I thought maybe I messed up icon imports. React #130 is infamous for this.
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-zinc-100 rounded p-4 text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code>
import { FaXTwitter } from "react-icons/fa6"; // âœ…
    </code></pre>
    <p>Still the error stayed, and so did my growing headache.</p>
    <p>
      I swapped out <code>react-icons</code> for <code>lucide-react</code>, thinking maybe Brave didn't like the old icon set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoiler: no luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly, this wasn't about icons anymore. This was personal.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">Brave is Blocking My Files?</h2>
    <p>
      Then I noticed something odd in DevTools. The error trace pointed to a file named:
      <code>ads.914af30a.js</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The name. "ads"? Like, ads-ads?
    </p>
    <p>
      Instant flashback: Brave hates anything that even smells like an ad. Could it be blocking my own JS chunks?
    </p>
    <p>
      So I popped open my <code>vite.config.ts</code> and told Vite:
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-zinc-100 rounded p-4 text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code>
// vite.config.ts
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      chunkFileNames: 'assets/[hash].js',      // Dynamic chunks
      entryFileNames: 'assets/[hash].js',      // Entry points
      assetFileNames: 'assets/[hash][extname]' // Assets like CSS/images
    }
  }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures Vite won't generate scary filenames like <code>ads.chunk.js</code>. Totally browser-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rebuilt. Refreshed. And guess what? Still broken.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">The Plot Twist I Didn't See Coming</h2>
    <p>
      Out of desperation, I clicked the error trace again â€” this time determined to follow every breadcrumb. I expanded the stack trace in DevTools, expecting to see something from my source files.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead, I noticed a weird nested structure:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-zinc-300 pl-4 text-sm text-zinc-600">
      content script > CSS Peeper > ads.[hash].js
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hold up. CSS Peeper?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's a Chrome/Brave extension I use to peek at styles. Apparently, it injects its own React app into every webpage like it owns the place. And that app... was crashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me repeat:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic text-zinc-700">
      I had been debugging someone else's React crash.  
      <br>For. Eight. Hours.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">The Real Villain Was Installed in My Browser All Along</h2>
    <p>
      Here's what was really happening:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>CSS Peeper injects a React UI into every page</li>
      <li>It loads a script named something like <code>ads.something.js</code></li>
      <li>That script broke</li>
      <li>React saw the crash and yelled</li>
      <li>Console blamed my app</li>
      <li>Brave possibly blocked it harder because of the "ads" name</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">The Fix (That Took Me 5 Seconds... After 8 Hours)</h2>
    <p>
      The fix? Comically simple:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
      <li>Open <code>brave://extensions</code></li>
      <li>Turn off CSS Peeper</li>
      <li>Reload the page</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Boom. Everything just worked.<br>
      Icons? Back. Text? Back. Me? Slightly traumatized.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">What I Learned (So You Don't Lose a Day Like Me)</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li><strong>Test in Incognito Mode First</strong> â€“ No extensions = fewer surprises.</li>
      <li><strong>Minified Errors Are Gaslighting You</strong> â€“ Use dev mode for real errors: <code>npm run dev</code></li>
      <li><strong>Be Careful With File Names</strong> â€“ Avoid words like <code>ads</code>, <code>sponsor</code>, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Double-Check Icon Imports</strong> â€“ Ensure imports aren't undefined.</li>
      <li><strong>Look for "content script" in DevTools</strong> â€“ Itâ€™s probably an extension crash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      Seeing React error #130 in Brave? Icons or text gone missing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you nuke your app:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>Try Incognito mode</li>
      <li>Check if any extensions are crashing</li>
      <li>Avoid ad-looking file names</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes the real bug lives rent-free in your browser.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      I lost an entire day to an error that wasn't mine. But now you don't have to.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're ever staring at your DevTools wondering what went wrong â€” remember to ask yourself:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic text-zinc-700">
      "Is this me? Or is this just Brave being Brave?"
    </blockquote>
    <p>Happy debugging. ðŸš€</p>
